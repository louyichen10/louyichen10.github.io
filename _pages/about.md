<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span> 

Hello! I‚Äôm **Yichen Lou (Â®ÑÊÄ°Êô®)**, a researcher in Statistics passionate about developing practical and flexible methods for complex data problems. I am currently a Research Fellow at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working under the supervision of [Prof. Liming Xiang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/lmxiang/). Before joining NTU, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Statistics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where I worked with [Prof. Xinyuan Song](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xysong/) and [Dr. Huichen Zhu](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/hczhu/).

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Jilin University, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Shishun Zhao](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/info/1061/9061.htm), [Dr. Peijie Wang](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/info/1062/9184.htm), and [Dr. Mingyue Du](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/info/1062/13162.htm). I was also very lucky to work closely with [Prof. Jianguo Sun](https://sunj.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/), whose guidance and support have meant so much to me, not only during my Ph.D. but also in how I think about research and life. His insight, integrity, and kindness have left a deep impression on me, and I'm truly thankful for everything I‚Äôve learned from him. I also had the joy of working closely with Dr. Yuqing Ma, who is not only a wonderful collaborator but also a dear friend who was always there to accompany and support me every step of the way.

My research interests include survival analysis, biased sampling, missing data, causal inference, change point problems, competing risks, and transfer learning. I am particularly interested in creating robust and efficient statistical tools that tackle real-world challenges in medical and epidemiological studies.

Thank you for visiting my page! Please feel free to explore my publications and reach out if you‚Äôd like to collaborate!
